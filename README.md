# PythonHousingPrediction1
Housing prediction prices based on many factors, such as the latitute, longitude, accommodates, bathrooms, bedrooms, etc.

### Context
On Airbnb, anyone who has a room or property of any type (apartment, house, cottage, inn, etc.) can offer it for rent on a daily basis.

The host create a profile and also an announcement about the property.

In this announcement, the host should describe the property's characteristics as comprehensively as possible to help renters/travelers choose the best property for them.

There are numerous customizations available in the announcement, including minimum stay requirements, price, number of rooms, cancellation policies, extra fees for additional guests, requirement of identity verification for renters, etc.


### The Objective
To build a price prediction model that allows common individuals who own a property to determine how much they should charge per night for their property.

Alternatively, for common renters, given the property they are seeking, to help determine if that property is competitively priced (below the average for properties with similar characteristics) or not.

### Credits
The datasets were obtained from the Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/allanbruno/airbnb-rio-de-janeiro

The datasets contain property prices and their respective characteristics for each month.
The prices are given in Brazilian Real (BRL).
We have data from April 2018 to May 2020, with the exception of June 2018, which does not have a dataset.
### Initial Expectations
I believe seasonality can be an important factor, as months like December tend to be quite expensive in Rio de Janeiro.
The location of the property should make a significant difference in the price since in Rio de Janeiro, location can completely change the characteristics of a place (safety, natural beauty, tourist attractions).
Additional amenities/facilities may have a significant impact, considering the presence of many old buildings and houses in Rio de Janeiro.
We will discover how much these factors impact prices and if there are other less intuitive factors that are extremely important.
